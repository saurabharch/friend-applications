#Introduction

Photopea is an advanced image editor, which can work with both raster and vector graphics. You can use it for simple tasks, such as resizing images, as well as complex tasks, such as designing webpages, creating illustrations, processing photographs and more.

#Colors
Right now, Photopea works with the sRGB color space (the basic color space for the web), with the 8-bit color depth. All exported files use sRGB, too.

#Starting and using Photopea
Photopea can run on any device (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone or any other computer), but for the best comfort, we recommend having a big screen, a precise pointing device (a mouse or a stylus) and a keyboard.

Photopea runs completely in your device, just like Sketch or Photoshop do. It does not upload any of your files to the internet. You can load Photopea.com, disconnect from the internet and keep using it completely offline. None of your files ever leaves your computer.
